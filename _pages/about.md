A passionate Ruby & Golang developer with 10+ years of experience, currently working at MSCI Inc. as an Associate in Pune, India. I have been with MSCI for over 4 years, focusing on JRuby, Python, event-based architecture, and Azure AKS. My work includes designing report generation systems using KEDA and developing workers to handle load efficiently.

As a Software Developer, I am not very big on the language and framework. I believe efficiency, productivity, and code maintainability rely mostly on how simple you can architect your solution.

I have also contributed to open-source projects at [@chef](https://github.com/chef), primarily working on microservices-based architecture for Chef Automate (automate.chef.io).

My expertise includes optimizing various Ruby on Rails web-based applications and extensive knowledge of Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. I have experience writing PL/SQL functions, procedures, and triggers, as well as working with materialized views, clustering, and table partitions.
